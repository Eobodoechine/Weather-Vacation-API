a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
Run linear regression on each relationship. This time, separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Randomly selected at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude. Performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.

Created a heat map that displays the humidity for every city from Part I. Narrow down the DataFrame to find ideal weather condition.

Used Google Places API to find the first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of your coordinates.

Plotted the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pin containing the Hotel Name, City, and Country.
